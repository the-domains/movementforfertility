It is not a generalized exercise program and it is not a practice to simply lessen feelings of stress when trying to conceive (although it will aid you in managing stressors in your life). Movement For Fertility™ is a program tailored to supporting your natural reproductive cycle and thus improving your ability to conceive and have a health pregnancy.   \n\nMovement For Fertility will:\n♥ correct any personal alignment issues hindering the function of organs vital to reproduction (thyroid, ovaries, uterus) \n\n♥ increase blood flow throughout your body and to specific areas important for conception, such as your uterus and ovaries\n\n♥ address any lymph congestion that can impact optimal function of your reproductive organs \n\n♥ restore hormonal balance and increase hormone circulation \n\nThrough this program you will be creating a more optimal environment for an embryo to implant and grow, whether you are trying to conceive naturally or pursing assisted reproductive technology.\n\nThe movements, or “exercises,” target all aspects that may be contributing to a difficulty in getting and/or staying pregnant. Movement for Fertility is a good program to begin as soon as you believe starting a or expanding your family is your desire.\n\nWhat does Movement For Fertility™ program entail?\n♥ An Initial 1 hour consultation (in-person, phone, or Skype) with creator (30 mins for 4-Week program)\n\n♥ 4 or 6 weeks of private, weekly MFF lessons with creator\n\n♥ A Movement For Fertility program tailored to support your specific reproductive health\n\n♥ An accountability journal or chart \n\n♥ Basic 3 Exercise handout \n\n♥ Fertility and Sleep Cycles by Amy of Red Tent Sisters\n\n \n\nBonus Material For the 6-Week Program\n♥ Babying Your Body PDF\n\nAn easy to follow guide on the key vitamins & minerals when trying to conceive & how to get them from food sources, supplements to consider, and environmental toxins & how best to avoid them. \n\n♥ Daily 6: Diet For Fertile Health\n\nA document outlining the top 6 foods to eat daily for fertile health.\n\n♥ First access to new videos, informational materials, workshops, retreats, and more.\n\n \n\nReady to get started on your journey to optimal fertility now?

I am Marie Wittman. I specialize in reproductive health and fertility. In particular, I address the structural elements of optimal reproductive function in women (and men). My journey to this work, although I didn’t know it at the time, began during my undergraduate studies, which was also when I began teaching Pilates. For many years, I traveled simultaneously down two distinct paths: academic studies and Pilates teaching. Then, following some extensive research into naturally improving my own fertility, these paths started to merge into one.\n\nI came to see that there is a major gap in the approaches to women’s reproductive health. So, I pulled together an array of movement programs Restorative Exercise™, Pilates (more on that below) and Redcord, I certified in Merciér Therapy, and I integrated my doctoral training into a multi-pronged approach to reproductive health.   \n\nIMG_5270I have been a well-known and respected Pilates instructor since 1998. I have studied and taught both “west-coast” and “east-coast” styles of Pilates. Preferring the classical repertoire of east-coast Pilates, I studied privately for two years with  Master Instructor Jill Cassady. This in-depth training incorporated all levels and all equipment created by Joseph Pilates. Constantly seeking to expand my knowledge, I continue my Pilates education through private sessions, workshops, and conferences with teachers such as Jay Grimes, Kathryn Ross-Nash, Brooke Siler, Peter Fiasca, Dana Santi, Chris Robinson, Siri Galliano, Jill Cassady, and Rebecca Leone.\n\nFascinated by all fields related to health, I also dedicate time and resources to broadening my education through studying and researching everything from kinesiology and biomechanics, to holistic health and wellness approaches, to nutrition. With a doctorate in medical history, both my teaching and writing have an academic foundation that greatly contributes to my goal to offer programs that complement medicine. Beyond fitness is optimal health, and this is the  intention behind every session, workshop, and class that I teach.\n\nLeg springs in the air-4390\n\nOver the course of my teaching career, I have taught a very diverse clientele. I have kept Olympic ice skaters, supermodels, professional dancers, and Cirque de Soleil performers in shape and injury-free. I have helped women stay healthy and strong during and after their pregnancies.\n\nI am very passionate about helping individuals with a wide-range of health issues improve their quality of life. I have worked with men and women who have diabetes, disc injuries, back and neck pain, fractures, severe scoliosis, knee pain, osteoporosis, and cancer.","keywords":[]},"content":[{"id":"e63a2ca0-e1e8-4ab3-aa63-21acbba94e0b","item":"c1b5dd97-6350-453c-a681-eb1181ecaa06","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":"A Little About Me ","_html":"<p>A Little About Me </p>","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":true,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]}},{"id":"3068786f-ef9e-416e-8578-cb2c036f5ad6","item":"c1b5dd97-6350-453c-a681-eb1181ecaa06","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":" Welcome!
