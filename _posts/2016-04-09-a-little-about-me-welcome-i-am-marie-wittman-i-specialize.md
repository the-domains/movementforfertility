A Little About Me 

Welcome! I am Marie Wittman. I specialize in reproductive health and fertility. In particular, I address the structural elements of optimal reproductive function in women (and men). My journey to this work, although I didn't know it at the time, began during my undergraduate studies, which was also when I began teaching Pilates. 

For many years, I traveled simultaneously down two distinct paths: academic studies and Pilates teaching. Then, following some extensive research into naturally improving my own fertility, these paths started to merge into one.
I came to see that there is a major gap in the approaches to women's reproductive health. So, I pulled together an array of movement programs Restorative Exercise(tm), Pilates (more on that below) and Redcord, I certified in Merciér Therapy, and I integrated my doctoral training into a multi-pronged approach to reproductive health.

I have been a well-known and respected Pilates instructor since 1998\. I have studied and taught both "west-coast" and "east-coast" styles of Pilates. Preferring the classical repertoire of east-coast Pilates, I studied privately for two years with Master Instructor Jill Cassady. This in-depth training incorporated all levels and all equipment created by Joseph Pilates. 

Constantly seeking to expand my knowledge, I continue my Pilates education through private sessions, workshops, and conferences with teachers such as Jay Grimes, Kathryn Ross-Nash, Brooke Siler, Peter Fiasca, Dana Santi, Chris Robinson, Siri Galliano, Jill Cassady, and Rebecca Leone. 

Fascinated by all fields related to health, I also dedicate time and resources to broadening my education through studying and researching everything from kinesiology and biomechanics, to holistic health and wellness approaches, to nutrition. 

With a doctorate in medical history, both my teaching and writing have an academic foundation that greatly contributes to my goal to offer programs that complement medicine. 

Beyond fitness is optimal health, and this is the intention behind every session, workshop, and class that I teach.

Over the course of my teaching career, I have taught a very diverse clientele. I have kept Olympic ice skaters, supermodels, professional dancers, and Cirque de Soleil performers in shape and injury-free. I have helped women stay healthy and strong during and after their pregnancies. 

I am very passionate about helping individuals with a wide-range of health issues improve their quality of life. I have worked with men and women who have diabetes, disc injuries, back and neck pain, fractures, severe scoliosis, knee pain, osteoporosis, and cancer.
